# Ollivanders Bibliography

> First of all, our team would like
> to thank David Gelpi Felta, Dual
> teacher and Github user [@dfleta](https://github.com/dfleta), for the work he has shared with

Of course we would also like to thank
> the hard and pioneering work of our
> colleagues Carlos Uriel
> [@Charlos16v](https://github.com/Charlos16v) and Juan Pastor Molia [@JuampaMolina](https://github.com/JuampaMolina), they have always been a source of inspiration and great support throughout the project.
